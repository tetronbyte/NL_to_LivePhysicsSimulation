STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) learners often struggle to understand complex word problems because they require mental visualisation of abstract concepts such as motion, shapes, forces, or relationships. Existing learning tools largely rely on static text or equations, limiting intuitive understanding and exploration.
Design and develop an Al-powered system that accepts Physics word problems as natural-language input and automatically converts them into interactive visual simulations or models. The system should intelligently interpret the problem context, extract key entities and parameters, and generate a dynamic visualisation that users can interact with and modify in real time.
The objective is to bridge the gap between textual problem statements and conceptual understanding, enabling learners to explore "what-if" scenarios by manipulating parameters and instantly observing their effects.
For example: A ball is thrown straight up with a speed of 10 m/s. Visualise the motion of the ball and allow the parameters to be adjusted in real time scenario.
The Participants must not need to visualise complex objects such as cars, bikes. They can represent them in form of dots with labels.

Expected Capabilities
1) Al-based understanding of Physics problem statements.
2) Conversion of unstructured text into structured representations.
3) Automatic generation of interactive visual models or simulations.
4) Real-time parameter manipulation and visual feedback.
5) Unified, intuitive user interface for exploration and learning.
